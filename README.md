### First Iteration Feedbacks

1. **Make the project applicable to the DIAG building.**  
   Ensure the project is tailored to the specific conditions and requirements of the DIAG building.

2. **Learning on the thing, not on the cloud.**  
   Focus on local learning and processing, rather than relying on cloud-based solutions.

3. **Support sampling frequency with numbers derived from real-world observations.**  
   Adjust the sampling frequency based on actual, observed data from real-world scenarios.

4. **Fix the duty cycle plot for proportional representation and correct the units.**  
   Ensure that the duty cycle plot is properly scaled, and correct the units of measurement. Additionally, implement hibernation mode instead of deep sleep.
